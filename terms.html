Moreover, Bitsnapp does not recommend that any cryptocurrency should be bought, sold or held by you and nothing in this App should be taken as an offer to buy, sell or hold a cryptocurrency.

Therefore, information provided by Bitsnapp should never be considered up-to-date, exhaustive or accurate and should not be used for any type of decision-making including, but not limited to, investments and trading.
THE APP AND ITS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND YOU ARE USING THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the limitations of this section may not apply to you.
The App is Ad-supported, provided at no cost and is intended for use as is. However, Bitsnapp is not responsible for any additional costs/expenses related, but not limited to, internet connection usage and third-party advertising.
IN NO EVENT SHALL BITSNAPP BE LIABLE (FOR ANY REASON) FOR ANY TYPE OF (A) LOSS, (B) COST, (C) EXPENSE, (D) LIABILITY, (E) DAMAGE, (F) MISSED PROFIT, (G) MISSED OPPORTUNITY, (H) UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR, (I) INJURY, (J) DEATH, HOWEVER ARISING, WHICH MAY OCCUR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF (i) DOWNLOADING THE APP, (ii) USING THE APP, (iii) THE KNOWLEDGE (BY YOU OR BY THIRD PARTIES) OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE APP, (iv) THE ELABORATION / REPORTING / PUBLISHING OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE APP, (v) THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE APP AND ANY SERVICES RELATED TO IT, (vi) THE UNINTENTIONAL / UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO DATA STORED ON YOUR DEVICE OR TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET BY THE APP (INCLUDING THE API KEYS YOU PROVIDED), (vii) THE UNINTENTIONAL / UNAUTHORIZED / IMPROPER USAGE BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OF THE API KEYS YOU PROVIDED, (viii) ANY LOSS OR LEAKAGE OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE APP.

    <h3>User’s responsibilities and obligations</h3><br><br>
   <p><b>It is your responsibility to ensure the API keys you are providing have read-only permissions level on the respective exchange account and that your device is kept safe. You are not allowed to use API keys on behalf of others or use API keys of an Exchange account of which you are not the legitimate holder.</b>
You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Bitsnapp.
The App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide the service. It’s your responsibility to keep your device and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your device vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your device’s security features and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.
Certain functions of the app will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Bitsnapp cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including, but not limited to, roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.
Along the same lines, Bitsnapp cannot take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service, Bitsnapp cannot accept responsibility.
At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on Android – the requirements for this system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Bitsnapp does not promise that it will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the operating system version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the App when offered to you.
Bitsnapp is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and delete it from your device.
